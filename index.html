            <p>&nbsp; Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Janet Strong and I am currently training full time to be certified in software development at We Can Code It Bootcamp, Cleveland, OH location. My past experience comes from several different sectors of the manufacturing industry holding positions at senior level management: operations to controller and various levels of account manager type positions.</p> 
            <p>&nbsp; I decided to transition into the software development field for a love of detail, curiousity and tenacity for working through a situation or problem until an answer is found. I thrive on a challenge, trying to understand why something works the way it does and being hands on within an active team environment to reach that goal or find the solution to that problem!</p>
